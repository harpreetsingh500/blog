 "If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.",
 "We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.",
 "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.",
 "Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.",
 "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind."
